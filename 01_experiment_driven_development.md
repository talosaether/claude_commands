### Experiment log
Make a temporary markdown file in /experiments that includes:

1. Our goal with this change - focus on the impact, not just the feature
2. Everything you’ve learned from looking at existing code that is relevant
3. A surgical plan of attack given the information

Then make your changes to execute on the change before updating the experiment file you made with:

1. Attempted solution

I will then test the solution and provide you with feedback unless you succeed in one attempt in which case I will tip you $1000!

If you fail, update the log with:

1. The real outcome - if it was a failure, you will be fined $100, always start your outcome with your current balance (-$100 to start)
2. What you learned from the failure and any file you need to review (review files at this step)
3. A new surgical plan given the updated info

Repeat.
